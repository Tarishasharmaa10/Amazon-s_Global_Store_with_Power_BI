#Amazons Global Store with PowerBI

I recently created a Simple Power BI dashboard for Amazon's Global Store using dataset from Kaggle 📊🌍

Here's what the Dashboard covers:-

- Comprehensive metrics such as total orders, customers, sales, profit, discounts, and product analytics.

- Insights into yearly and weekly order trends by category, prioritized shipping details, and top-ordering countries.

- Market Specific analysis highlighting product uptake.

- Detailed breakdowns of Sales by country and profitability by region.

- Visualizations showing regional order trends and detailed sales insights by country.

Your Feedback / Suggestions on this project would be greatly appreciated 😊.
